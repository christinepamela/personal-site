  <h1>Innovation Underdogs: The Corporate Rebel Playbook</h1>
  <p><strong>by Christine Pamela Chandrakasan</strong><br>
  Entrepreneur • Strategist • Systems Builder</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Book Overview</h2>
    <p>What happens when a breakthrough idea lands in a company that was never designed to change?</p>
    <p><em>Innovation Underdogs</em> is a strategic guide for building lasting innovation inside large, complex, or traditional organizations. With real-world case studies, visual frameworks, and grounded storytelling, it charts a path from resistance to reinvention—without breaking what already works.</p>
    <p>At its core is the <strong>Theta Framework</strong>, a visual model that maps six types of innovation—Core, Adjacent, Architectural, Disruptive, Transformational, and Frontier—across three corporate zones: Core, Edge, and Beyond.</p>

    <h2>Why This Book, Why Now</h2>
    <p>Since 2000, over half of the Fortune 500 has vanished. McKinsey predicts the average S&P 500 lifespan will shrink to 12 years by 2027. While many companies claim to innovate, few rewire their identity when technology demands it.</p>
    <p>This book fills the gap between startup idealism and corporate reality—offering a system that makes breakthrough innovation stick.</p>
